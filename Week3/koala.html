                <h3>KOALAS</h3>
                <p>Koalas typically inhabit open eucalypt woodlands, and the leaves of these trees make up most 
                of their diet. Because this eucalypt diet has limited nutritional and caloric content, koalas 
                are largely sedentary and sleep up to 20 hours a day. They are asocial animals, and bonding 
                exists only between mothers and dependent offspring. Adult males communicate with loud bellows 
                that intimidate rivals and attract mates.</p> 
                <p>Males mark their presence with secretions from scent 
                glands located on their chests. Being marsupials, koalas give birth to underdeveloped young that 
                crawl into their mothers' pouches, where they stay for the first six to seven months of their lives.
                 These young koalas, known as joeys, are fully weaned around a year old. Koalas have few natural 
                 predators and parasites, but are threatened by various pathogens, such as Chlamydiaceae bacteria 
                 and the koala retrovirus, as well as by bushfires and droughts.</p>
                <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</strong></p>
                <p>You will find the koalas next to the giraffe enclosure.</p>
