                <h3>ELEPHANTS</h3>
                <p>Elephants are the largest living land animals. Three living species are currently recognised: the African bush elephant (Loxodonta africana), 
                    the African forest elephant (L. cyclotis), and the Asian elephant (Elephas maximus). 
                    They are the only surviving members of the family Elephantidae and the order Proboscidea; extinct relatives include mammoths and mastodons
                </p>
                <p>Elephants have a fissionâ€“fusion society, in which multiple family groups come together to socialise. Females (cows) tend to live in family groups, 
                    which can consist of one female with her calves or several related females with offspring. The leader of a female group, usually the oldest cow, 
                    is known as the matriarch.</p>
                    <p>Elephants are herbivorous and can be found in different habits including savanna, forest, deserts and marshes. They prefer to stay near water</p>
                    <p><strong> WERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</strong></p>
                    <P>You will find the elephant at pen E22, right next to the amphitheatre</P>
